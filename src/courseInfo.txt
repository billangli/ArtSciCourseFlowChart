As of 2007, for the first time in human history, more than half the worlds peoples lived in cities. It is estimated that by 2030 over 60% will be urban-dwellers. This demographic shift suggests that for many (if not most) people, their primary encounter with "nature" will be urban based. This course explores the idea of "urban-nature" by 1) focusing on the ways in which various theorists have challenged traditional ways of viewing both "the city" and "nature" and 2) encouraging students to develop their own critical perspectives through ethnographic engagements with the city of Toronto.

Topics that will be covered are eukaryogenesis, junk DNA, the structure of DNA and chromatin, the transfer of information between genotype and phenotype, the filtering of information found in the genome into biologically relevant molecules such as mRNA, the processing and export of these products from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and the translation of mRNA into protein. We will also investigate how various organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, played a role in the evolution of the nucleus. Finally we will investigate how biological information is partitioned during mitosis.

What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.

ENV461H1:  The U of T Campus as a Living Lab of Sustainability 
24L
Sustainability is a growing priority for universities all over the world. Many are developing strong operational sustainability goals and targets, and are giving increasing emphasis to teaching and research on sustainability issues. Yet few have committed at the executive level to integrating academic and operational sustainability in the context of treating their campus as a living laboratory of sustainable practice, research and teaching. Arguably, it is such living lab approaches that offer the largest potential for universities to play a significant role in the sustainability transition. This course will explore and apply the living lab concept, in the context of operational sustainability at the University of Toronto. We will begin by looking at the literature on university sustainability and the living lab concept. The bulk of the course will involve undertaking an applied research project on some aspect of campus sustainability, working in close partnership with operational staff at the University of Toronto. Students will develop the skills needed to work across disciplines and fields of study, and with non-academic partners. This course will put students to work on operational sustainability projects identified by the staff working in or with the Sustainability Office at the University of Toronto. Students will be organized into groups, each of which will be assigned one project, to be overseen by one or more U of T staff members. The bulk of the course will consist of regular meetings with the staff "clients", with instructors, and in small groups to undertake a group project. Each group will produce a mid-term and final report, and give a mid-term and final presentation. Each student will also submit two 360 reviews of the group process. A crucial aspect of this course is the ability of students to work collaboratively together in a group environment, and to work effectively with a university staff person acting as a "client" for their work. Students will be provided with a Handbook outlining information on working in groups and the focus of the class in the second week will be on this issue. The first 360 peer review will serve to provide information on how well each group is working. Students are encouraged to discuss and resolve group process issues in the weekly group meetings, and in their regular meetings with the instructor and TA. The second 360 review will occur at the end of the term. The results of the two 360 reviews will be used, where appropriate, to adjust individual marks from the group averages.

FAH406H1:  Cross-Cultural Issues in Ancient Art Beyond Greece and Rome 
24S
When cultures collide, they assimilate, they exchange, they transform, and they develop, and there seems to be a pattern of recognizable centres of power around which artistic tradition often revolves. This has caused the conventional understanding of certain flowering of artistic heritage as a product of cross-cultural influences. This course is a seminar style survey that explores these fascinating amalgams of artistic traditions that lie at the Eastern outskirts of the Hellenistic world throughout the roman Period, from Bactria to India, and with a heavy focus on the Buddhist art of Gandhara, reaching out along the Silk Road. As the title suggests, the class aims at a renewed framework that re-evaluates the role of the Ancient West, which has been absent since the heavily Eurocentric scholarship from the early 20th century. It also aims to familiarize students with current theoretical issues surrounding cross-cultural studies as it pertains to the visual arts, touching upon modern postcolonial theories of space.

FAH423H1:  The Palaces of Minoan Crete 
24L
Around 2000 BC, the island of Crete sees the emergence of what are arguably the earliest towns and states in European prehistory. At the heart of this new social order are the so-called palaces, massive architectural complexes usually interpreted as seats of administrative and political authority. However, fresh discoveries over the past two decades, coupled recently with radical new interpretations, require a fundamental rethinking of the nature of the palaces and their role in Minoan society. This course will provide students with an active opportunity to learn about the latest developments in Minoan art, architecture, and archaeology.

FAH435H1:  Correggio 
24S
Exhibitions, symposia and several publications have recently re-considered the art of the High Renaissance artist Correggio (1489/1494?-1534), but its understanding remains problematic within the current paradigms of Italian Renaissance art. As has been often observed, Correggio was and still is an undervalued artist. This seminar will consider Correggio's most ambitious works of art of his short career - his altarpieces, dome decorations and amazing erotic images - and reconstruct their meanings to familiarize undergraduate students with an overlooked corpus of works in the general histories of Renaissance art, while providing them with the basic art historical research tools in the field of Italian Renaissance art.

FAH490H1:  Introduction to the Textile Arts of the Indian Ocean World 
24S
The Indian Ocean has been called the Cradle of Globalization. For thousands of years monsoon winds linked the people and arts of this vast Ocean that stretches from East Africa in the West to Indonesia (and beyond) in the East. Throughout its long history, handwoven textiles have been amongst the area's greatest art forms, trade goods, religious objects and markers of identity. This course will survey the wide variety of these forms, from c. 1100 to 1950. Special attention is placed on India, which lies at the center of the region, and originated many of the fibres, techniques, design and iconography of the wider area. Select regional manifestations are then examined in depth, using the ROM's extensive collections. These range from the silks of Madagascar, to embroidered men's wear of Oman, to the cosmopolitan batiks of northern coastal Java. It is seen that all these traditions can best be understood within the framework of the wider Indian Ocean region.

GGR216H1:  Global Cities 
24L
Most urban courses taught in the English-speaking world implicitly or explicitly focus on large North American, European, or Australian cities. While these places are interesting in their own right, studying them as the sole model of urbanization is misleading. To a great extent, the societies of the westernized, developed world are already highly-urbanized and have been so for decades. Cities outside of this sphere, by contrast, are generally growing much faster, and experiencing greater social and economic upheaval as a result. Understanding non-North American urbanization is a vital part of understanding cities in general. This course is an attempt to introduce students to processes of urbanization that are occurring in places other than North America. There will be a particular focus on comparing the urban form, economies, and social life in cities around the world.

GGR431H1:  Regional Dynamics 
24L
Economic activity, and related indices of socioeconomic well-being and human capital, have always tended to concentrate in space, leaving specific regions to be classified as "creative", "developed", or "core" regions and others as "have-not", "less-developed", "peripheral", or "marginal" regions. As a result, regional economic change has been very difficult to fully explain (and certainly predict) using conventional (orthodox) theories and methods. This course examines the theoretical linkage between related trends in terms of globalization, vertical disintegration, specialization, innovation, and the locational behaviour of firms. We will focus on the seemingly counter-intuitive finding that regional economic change in a time of increasing global interdependence is increasingly dependent on the local context. Topics will include evolutionary economic geography, path dependence, economic clusters, learning regions, the role of institutions, knowledge spill-overs, and the geography of innovation, among others. We will see why the economic activity is becoming ever more concentrated in space even as it globalizes. The course makes extensive use of empirical case studies from around the globe.

GGR452H1:  Space, Power, Geography: Understanding Spatiality 
24S
Our understanding of space and power has shifted radically in the past half century. Space no longer implies only regions, nations or territory; power is not simply a question of domination, control, or forms of political representation. Space and power are intricately related. This course explores a shift in our ways of thinking about space and power, focusing specifically on the works of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. Through the works of Deleuze and Foucault, students are introduced to a variety of ways that space and power are organized and contested. The course begins with the maps in our heads: what kinds of spatial systems organize dominant world-views, how have these changed over time? What spatial metaphors do we use to think about power - as hidden and operating at a depth, or as a surface effect? How does the social organization of space figure in the development of different technologies and techniques of power? How do technologies of power become organized, serialized, dispersed, transformed and contested?

Innovation has always been a key driver of economic growth, population health, and societal success. Transformative change has historically been linked to major innovations such as urban sanitation, pasteurization, the printing press and the industrial revolution. Currently, the opportunity to enhance life chances worldwide relies on innovating for the poor, social innovation, and the ability to harness scientific and technological knowledge. What precisely is innovation? When does innovation happen? Who benefits from innovation? How can innovation be fostered, and how do innovations spread? Relying on major global transformations and country-specific case studies (for example, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and India), this course examines the drivers of innovation, the political, social, economic, and scientific and technological factors that are critical to promoting innovation and addressing current global challenges, and the consequences of innovation.

This course provides a survey of Physics, including both Classical and Modern Physics. It is designed for non-scientists, and assumes no background in either science or mathematics. The approach to the course is broad rather than deep. We will concentrate on the concepts underlying such fascinating topics as planetary motion, chaos, the nature of light, time travel, black holes, matter waves, Schrodinger's cat, quarks, and climate change. We will uncover the wonders of the classical and the quantum worlds courtesy of Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Heisenberg and many others.

PHY101H1:  Emergence in Nature 
24L/12T
The universe is not a rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, it is filled with highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from simple rules of physics. Examples range from the structure of galaxies to the pattern of ripples on windblown sand, to biological and even social processes. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? Self-organization challenges the usual reductionistic scientific method, and begs the question of whether we can ever really understand or predict truly complex systems.

Drawing on readings from political philosophy, legal theory, and normative international relations theory, the course will take up practical ethical dilemmas encountered in world affairs. The main focus of the course will be on institutions. Examples will be drawn from the issue areas of trade, health, and the environment, among others.

36S
We will critically examine what "comparative political theory" is and what it would mean to genuinely "deparochialize" political theory, that is, to de-center Euro-American thought in the study of political ideas. The course neither presupposes background knowledge of any non-Western thought tradition, nor does it aspire to provide students with sufficient knowledge of particular traditions to ground serious scholarly contributions to this emerging field. To provide that background would require a series of specialized courses in, e.g., East Asian political thought, Indian political thought, Latin American political thought, Indigenous political thought, African political thought, and so on. Rather, the course aims at sharpening our understanding of (a) the purposes served by "deparochializing" political theory; and (b) the various methods by which we can seek to serve these purposes.

What does it mean to be modern? Words like modern, modernity, and modernism are used to mark a fundamental boundary between our era and all that came before it (or lies outside of it); but most of us are hard-pressed to offer a solid account of what exactly this boundary is. This course examines the relationship between: a fundamental shift in the nature of daily experience; an order-of-magnitude expansion of the power of the State; a dramatic reorganization of religious experience and cultures; and a tremendous growth in the enterprise of Western science and technological production. We trace this reorientation over the last two centuries and examine its consequences using philosophical, literary, theological, and scientific sources, as well as recent scholarly work on the topic.

24L/12T
This course examines how society has gone about controlling specific types of deviants (e.g., gang members, sex and drug offenders) and acts of deviance (e.g., organized crime, the deviance of social control agents).

This course will study accounts of world travelers and explorers from the Middle Ages to the present, including representative examples drawn from the Age of Exploration, the Grand Tour, scientific and map-making expeditions, and the contemporary genre of travel writing. Particular attention will be given to the trans-cultural nature of travel, and the interactive aspects of the gulf between the observer and those observed. Students will analyze the diverse motivational factors behind excursions and expeditions, and apply a critique to written accounts in light of such factors as self-discovery, knowledge and imagination, Eurocentrism, orientalism, cultural relativism, colonialism/imperialism, race, gender, and eco-tourism.Not eligible for CR/NCR option.

This course examines two key issues about the performing arts that concern both artists and theorists: the nature of interpretation and of expression. What might we mean when we say that a work, a piece of music or a dance for example expresses something? What is it to express? And what is the nature of interpretation? Are there any constraints or boundaries on interpretation? We will draw on both philosophers and non-philosophers to explore these sorts of questions.Not eligible for CR/NCR option.

VIC118H1:  The Rebel in History, Literature and Popular Culture 
24S
This course will examine the phenomenon of individuals and communities who rebel against the general social norms upheld by the majority in societies throughout history. These societal conventions can include generally-accepted moral and religious tenets, as well as the formal legal or political powers employed by those with the levers of social control. The rebels' motives can range from the purely criminal, as with many notorious outlaws, to struggles for social justice, in the case of rebellious slaves or proponents of civil disobedience. Students will develop a theoretical framework which they can apply to the lives and motivations of a diverse representation of social rebels and outsiders, among them: pirates and mutineers, bandits and members of street/biker gangs, anarchists, disaffected intellectuals and religious leaders, punks and goths. Besides examining the sociological and philosophical aspects of rebellion, the course will consider the rebel as a prominent element in popular culture.Not eligible for CR/NCR option.

VIC134H1:  Globalization 
24S
This interdisciplinary course explores the contemporary character of globalization. The world is shrinking as money, goods, people, ideas, weapons, and information flow across national boundaries. Some commentators assert that a more tightly interconnected world can exacerbate financial disruptions, worsen the gap between rich and poor nations, undermine democracy, imperil national cultures, harm the environment, and give unconstrained freedom to predatory corporations. Others proclaim that globalization - understood as capitalism and free markets - fosters economic growth, encourages creative collaboration, inspires technological breakthroughs, and enhances human prospects for a better life, in rich and poor countries alike, in unprecedented ways. Our task is to evaluate the evidence and draw our own conclusions.Not eligible for CR/NCR option.
